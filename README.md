__AI Chatbot using Streamlit and Python__

This is an AI-powered chatbot built using Streamlit and Python. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate responses to user inputs in real-time. The project demonstrates how to integrate machine learning models with a web-based interface using Streamlit.

__Features:__

 - Real-time Chat Interface: The chatbot allows users to interact with it via a simple chat interface built using Streamlit.
 - AI-Powered Responses: The chatbot uses a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-based or a custom model) to generate responses based on user input.
 - Easy to Deploy: The app is easy to deploy using Streamlit, allowing others to run and test the chatbot.

__Technologies Used__
 - Python: The backend programming language used to build the chatbot logic.
 - Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web apps quickly with Python.
